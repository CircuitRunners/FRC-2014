Code for the CircuitRunners FRC Team 1002 for the 2014 Challenge: Aerial Assist

CircuitRunners FRC code is based on a simple, one file method to execute manipulator functions.

The Aerial Assist project features drive code for 6-wheel tank drive, logic for a winch to operate for a certain distance,
logic for a cam to rotate, release the winch, and stop in the starting position, and logic for operation of a forklift.
